#### category

#### morphism

There are two objects that are associated to every morphism, the source and the target. A morphism f with source X and target Y is written f : X â†’ Y, and is represented diagrammatically by an arrow from X to Y.

For many common categories, objects are sets (often with some additional structure) and morphisms are functions from an object to another object. Therefore, the source and the target of a morphism are often called domain and codomain respectively.

#### identity function

In mathematics, an identity function, also called an identity relation or identity map or identity transformation, is a function that always returns the same value that was used as its argument. That is, for f being identity, the equality f(x) = x holds for all x.
